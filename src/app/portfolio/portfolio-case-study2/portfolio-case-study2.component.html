                <p class="text-dark fs-6 fw-light  col-12 m-0 px-3 py-2">In 2009, during the government of former President Michelle Bachelet, it was announced that Chile was moving to adopt the Japanese standard ISDB-T, marking the beginning of the path towards terrestrial digital television (TVD) in Chile.

                  The legislation took five more years to write into law, with it finally being introduced in 2014. This new legislation marked the shutdown of analogue television broadcast across Chile, with a final deadline of April 2024.

      <h2 class="text-dark fs-2 font-family-PP Monument Extended col-12 m-0 px-3 py-2">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-dark fs-6 fw-light  col-12 m-0 px-3 py-2">With the shutdown of analogue television looming, it was important to educate the country about what this transition from analogue to digital meant for them and to ensure they had everything they needed for this transition. The transition from analogue to digital would require the purchase of some additional hardware that would come at a cost for some of the public, so it was important to ensure that they were made aware of this so that they could purchase the required hardware before the shutdown.

        As part of this process it was important to ensure that a large number of stakeholders across the country were involved in the rollout, this included Governmental entities; General Secretariat of Government, the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications, the Undersecretariat of Telecommunications (SUBTEL), All Chilean National TV networks gathered under (Anatel), the National Television Council and All Chilean Regional TV networks gathered under (Arcatel).

        To add to all of this the date for the shutdown was set for April 15 and there was just 4 weeks to develop and rollout the campaign.</p>

                  <h2>The Solution</h2>
                  <p class="text-end text-dark fs-6 fw-light  col-12  m-0 px-3 py-2">
                    It was important for us to put together a campaign that was accessible and relatable to Chileans. With that in mind we created the “Los Téves”, a cartoon TV family that embodied the typical middle-class Chilean Family. 

                    The Los Téves were made up of 8 family members that each contributed to teaching the nation what was required for the switch and where to find the related technical materials.

                    The campaign itself highlighted the history of TV in Chile, how to set up your TV for the transition to digital (and associated hardware required) as well as the positives of the transition to digital.

              <p class="text-dark fs-6 fw-light  col-xl-4 col-md-10 col-sm-12 px-3 py-2 col-4">It was important to get the messaging right, so we used the Los Téves family to convey a message of community. With younger members of the family lending a hand to more senior family, neighbours and friends, while encouraging the viewers to do the same. We also took this opportunity to take the Los Téves across Chile, with the family visiting different regions across the country.</p>

                  <p class="text-end text-dark fs-6 fw-light  col-12  m-0 px-3 py-2">Being a working dog, Pink Dog is always up for some hard graft, and without hesitation we flung ourselves straight into the biggest job of all. The design and build of the new facility.
                    With construction finished on the facility, it was time for us to do a spot of demolition and rebuilding on the BLT website.

                    We removed large chunks of the site that were needlessly convoluted and replaced them with an easily navigable Ui that clearly highlighted BLT’s services, locations, customer reviews, storage sizing charts and, of course, prices.

                    We also took the opportunity to add a simple back end to the website to take care of payments and customer accounts.</p>

            <p class=" fs-6 fw-light  m-0 px-3 py-2 " style="text-align: left;">A self-storage company that was absolutely delighted.

              They loved their eye-catching and environmentally sustainable facility and were thrilled (and, truth be told, massively relieved) to have a simplified wayfinding system that made their customers’ lives easier.

              The newly designed website also met with universal acclaim. Staff were overjoyed to finally have a site for promoting their services, establishing brand credibility, increasing visibility and facilitating lead generation.

              The refurbished in-facility offices were also a roaring success, providing a comfortable and welcoming space for the team to work and serve customers.</p>

          <h2 class=" fs-2  m-0 px-3 py-2" style="text-align: left;">Project Impact</h2>
          <p class=" fs-6 fw-light  m-0 px-3 py-2 col-10 " style="text-align: left;">On the strength of this new facility, BLT secured themselves a $60M USD investment in the business through an investment fund managed by Banchile.

            This in turn has allowed BLT to commence plans for a further 12 new facilities across the Santiago Metropolitan region.

            All of which has enabled them to be the undisputed top dog in South America’s self-storage industry. BRAVO!!!

            And speaking of top dogs, if you have a project or commission you’d like to bring to life, then give us a whistle.</p>
