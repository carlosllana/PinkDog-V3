We began by modernising their core brand, updating key brand assets logos, fonts and colour palettes. As brand heritage was very important to Caleu we opted to keep their signature brand \u2018red\u2019, subtly updating the tone to ensure it complimented the new \u2018mint green\u2019 colour we introduced to help convey the brand eco-friendly brand value. We added a new chevron element to the brand, helping convey movement representing the product distribution side of the brand. This chevron was designed to be used alongside the \u2018c\u2019 of the brand creating a simple brandmark to be used when the longer form logo is not needed. As part of the refresh we also defined a new brand \u201CCaleu Hogar\u201D which is targeted at a younger and more digitally savvy audience. With the brand update complete we moved onto refreshing Caleu\u2019s workspace, concentrating on their offices and distribution centre. The redesign of the workspace highlights the vibrancy of the brand, brand colours have been used to activate spaces and exposed timber has been introduced to add natural warmth to the overall space. We embraced natural light, opted for simple yet stylish furniture, and installed versatile, transparent dividers that double as a functional screen and subtly conceal bathroom areas.

Working with ACS\u2019s internal marketing team we reviewed the supplied design taking into consideration any and all functionality needed, how it would translate for mobile, brand implementation and light/dark mode variants. From this we got to work creating a design system made up of various components on which each email template would be built upon, once built these were brought into Adobe Campaign where they were setup and tested ensuring they worked well across all common hardware, email client and browser configurations commonly used by ACS members.

Go+ successfully aims to provide products that are premium but still affordable. Parent company Rinde Mas approached Pink Dog to help create the look of their new Go+ brand and ensure their new detergent and cleaning products stood out in a space with a lot of competition. We began by updating the logo and colour palette. We opted for a bold and simple logo, with a \u2018pill\u2019 below encapsulating the product name on each product. We chose primary colours for their versatility and visual impact, with the blue colour chosen to work in tandem with the existing blue colour of their best-selling laundry detergent. With the branding nailed down, we moved on to the labels and packaging. We used the primary colours set out in the brand guideline to categorise each product's label with its own key colour, which compliments the bright colours of the cleaning liquids inside each bottle. The colour of the cleaning products themselves is highlighted with clear and opaque product packaging with embossed Go+ logo. With the brand and packaging locked down, we moved onto the social media creating social media templates and strategy to market their products on their social media channels. We also introduced the \u201CDon Rinde\u201D company mascot, who is featured throughout the social media campaign and through custom social media stickers.
